A brief technical writing on JavaScript variables
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. A variable is a named container that holds a value, which can be of various types, including numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and more.

To declare a variable in JavaScript, you can use the var, let, or const keyword, followed by the variable name, and optionally, an initial value
var name = "John";  // declaring a variable called 'name' and assigning it the value "John"
let age = 30;       // declaring a variable called 'age' and assigning it the value 30
const PI = 3.14;    // declaring a constant called 'PI' and assigning it the value 3.14

Variables can also be declared without an initial value:
var x;
const y;
Let z;
